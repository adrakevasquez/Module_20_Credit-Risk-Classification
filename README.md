A summary:
When comparing the imbalanced to the oversampled data, it is clear that the oversampled data provided a noticably more accurate model than it's counterpart. Here, you see there were only 4 instances of false negatives (FN) while the imbalanced data had 56 (14x more). Addtionally, the recall score improved from 91% to 99% which is a significant change.
